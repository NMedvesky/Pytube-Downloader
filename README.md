Pytube Downloader for windows

This is a extended cmd feature for pytube
See the github page for pytube https://github.com/pytube/pytube

If you want to download this there are 3 ways
1. Download just the zip and unzip it which will have all the files except the .py
2. Download all the files except the .zip and .py
3. Download all the files except the .zip and .exe and use a Python interpreter to run it

note: The .exe and .py are the same code but the exe is ready to go and with the .py it requires a Python interpreter

To get started launch the Setup.bat file it will create a shortcut on the desktop for
the program and create a default downloads folder at C:users\user\Videos\Pytube_Downloads

If you encounter any errors contact Niko
If you move the entire directory you will need to make a new shortcut using Setup.bat
